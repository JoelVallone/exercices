The standard way to compile this program is with the command
  gcc hello.c -o hello 

Alternatively, the above program could be compiled using the following two commands.
  g++ -c hello.c
  g++ hello.o -o hello 
The end result is the same, but this two-step method first compiles hello.C into a machine code file named "hello.o" and then links hello.o with some system libraries to produce the final program "hello".
